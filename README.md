                                                       Abstract
                                        
Twitter has frequently served as a platform for political and social discussion, playing a notable role in organizing protests, serving as a form of civil disobedience, and being used as a means of expressing outrage over social events. We seek to further research aspects of Twitter conversations (specifically their use of Twitter hashtags), which allow them to remain connected and bring together individuals and groups with differing opinions. Our hope is that, by finding these characteristics of Twitter hashtags, we can further elucidate methods of sustaining debate and discussion around political and social movements as well as bridging various communities of thought. We focus specifically on the Twitter conversations related to the August 2014 shooting of 18-year old Michael Brown, which have been centered on the hashtag #ferguson. We generate both undirected graphs and multigraphs to represent this Twitter conversation using co-occurring hashtags. We run two experiments on our graphs in order to investigate the effect on connectivity of node influence, edge presence and frequency, as well as node presence and frequency.

                                                  Problem Definition
                                                  
Beginning with a database of 1.3 million tweets surrounding the #ferguson hashtag, we examine each tweet and extract the hashtags from within the text. We use the term ”co-occurrence” to refer to when a pair of hashtags both appear in a given tweet. While processing our data, we also keep track of the number of times each co-occurrence, defined by a pair of hashtags, occurs. By rendering a graph of hashtags as nodes, linked with a weighted (or multi-graph) edge representing the rate of co-occurrence, we are able to look for further insight into the following questions:

1. Does the ‘strength of weak ties’ concept apply for Twitter hashtags? In other words, are tweets sharing less frequently co-occurring, or more frequently co-occurring, hashtags keeping widespread conversations like #ferguson connected?
2. What role do the most-popular hashtags, such as #ferguson, play in keeping a conversation going? In other words, if it were not for these extremely common hashtags ‘anchoring’ a conversation, would the related tweets no longer be connected, or might they be connected with a more diverse collection of hashtags?

We want to consider the role that hashtags play in keeping a conversation connected and widespread, rather than a single hashtag’s lifetime in the network. These questions connect two areas of research: the first examines what makes hashtags or blog posts viral, persistent, influential, and sticky (i.e. they catch on quickly after relatively few impressions). The second is about the global efficiency principle (the weight of a link should correlate with the number of shortest paths passing through it), the strength of weak ties , and the (alternative) dyadic hypothesis (the strength of a link is independent of its network context) [4]. Prior work on this data set has indicated that there are clear clusters or sub-conversations linked to the #ferguson hashtag [6].
