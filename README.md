                                                       Abstract
                                        
Twitter has frequently served as a platform for political and social discussion, playing a notable role in organizing protests, serving as a form of civil disobedience, and being used as a means of expressing outrage over social events. We seek to further research aspects of Twitter conversations (specifically their use of Twitter hashtags), which allow them to remain connected and bring together individuals and groups with differing opinions. Our hope is that, by finding these characteristics of Twitter hashtags, we can further elucidate methods of sustaining debate and discussion around political and social movements as well as bridging various communities of thought. We focus specifically on the Twitter conversations related to the August 2014 shooting of 18-year old Michael Brown, which have been centered on the hashtag #ferguson. We generate both undirected graphs and multigraphs to represent this Twitter conversation using co-occurring hashtags. We run two experiments on our graphs in order to investigate the effect on connectivity of node influence, edge presence and frequency, as well as node presence and frequency.

                                                  Problem Definition
                                                  
Beginning with a database of 1.3 million tweets surrounding the #ferguson hashtag, we examine each tweet and extract the hashtags from within the text. We use the term ”co-occurrence” to refer to when a pair of hashtags both appear in a given tweet. While processing our data, we also keep track of the number of times each co-occurrence, defined by a pair of hashtags, occurs. By rendering a graph of hashtags as nodes, linked with a weighted (or multi-graph) edge representing the rate of co-occurrence, we are able to look for further insight into the following questions:

1. Does the ‘strength of weak ties’ concept apply for Twitter hashtags? In other words, are tweets sharing less frequently co-occurring, or more frequently co-occurring, hashtags keeping widespread conversations like #ferguson connected?
2. What role do the most-popular hashtags, such as #ferguson, play in keeping a conversation going? In other words, if it were not for these extremely common hashtags ‘anchoring’ a conversation, would the related tweets no longer be connected, or might they be connected with a more diverse collection of hashtags?

We want to consider the role that hashtags play in keeping a conversation connected and widespread, rather than a single hashtag’s lifetime in the network. These questions connect two areas of research: the first examines what makes hashtags or blog posts viral, persistent, influential, and sticky (i.e. they catch on quickly after relatively few impressions). The second is about the global efficiency principle (the weight of a link should correlate with the number of shortest paths passing through it), the strength of weak ties , and the (alternative) dyadic hypothesis (the strength of a link is independent of its network context) [4]. Prior work on this data set has indicated that there are clear clusters or sub-conversations linked to the #ferguson hashtag [6].

                                                      Data Model
We rendered our data as a network with the underlying format (hashtag1, hashtag2, co-occurrence-count), where each hashtag is a node. Therefore, each node id is a hashtag id, and the edge weight is the co- occurrence-count). Given this underlying representation, we represent the co-occurrence network in the following way:
Undirected Weighted Graph Network: An edge between two nodes represents that there is least one co-occurrence of the two hashtags represented by the two nodes, and the edge has an attribute that is the count of tweets those hashtags co-occurred in. Hashtags in the dataset that never co-occurred with another hashtag are represented as zero degree nodes. We also considered a version that excluded zero-degree nodes. We did not find significant differences between these two in terms of global attributes on the graph, except, of course the number of zero-degree nodes, so we used the representation including these zero-degree nodes since we are studying the role hashtags play in connectivity on their own and in co-occurring pairs.
In order to understand the role co-occurring hashtags and individual hashtags play in the graph’s connec- tivity, we conducted two different experiments to measure connectivity as a function of particular removed edges and nodes:

Experiment 1 (edge removal): We removed edges in increasing order of their weight (which is their relative co-occurrence rate). We defined a timestep to be the removal of 1/100th of edges in the original graph. At each timestep, we measured the estimated diameter, number of connected components, and the fraction of the largest connected component of the remaining graph. We repeated this process two additional times. In the second occurrence of this experiment, we removed edges in decreasing order of their weight and in the final occurrence, we removed edges in random order.

Experiment 2 (node removal): We removed nodes in increasing order of their frequency in the original dataset. We defined a timestep to be the removal of 1/100th of nodes in the original graph. At each timestep, we measured the estimated diameter, number of connected components, and the fraction of the largest connected component of the remaining graph. We repeated this process two additional times. In the second occurrence of this experiment, we removed nodes in decreasing order of their frequency and in the final occurrence, we removed nodes in random order.
