Stats on Hashtag Co-occurrence Graph
(Using Bidirectional Multigraph) 
       Two edges to represent one undirected edge
       plus multiple edges between 

================
From Print Info (snap.PrintInfo):
  Nodes:                    30513
  Edges:                    1562114
  Zero Deg Nodes:           0
  Zero InDeg Nodes:         0
  Zero OutDeg Nodes:        0
  NonZero In-Out Deg Nodes: 30513

  # note, the number of real edges should be 1/2 of the amount listed above

Degree Info:
* Max Degree Node ID: 9317
* Degree of Node 9317: 396913 (793826 because of the 2 edges for bidirectionality)

NOTE: XXX means I'm currently computing this. I just wanted to push my current stats in case anyone needed them.

Edge Info: 
* Count UniqBiDirEdges: XXX

Connectivity Info:
* IsWeaklyConn(graph) => false
* IsConnected(graph) => false
* Max SCC Size => 0.9687018647789467

Clustering Coefficient:
* Clustering coefficient => XXX
* Number of triads => XXX 

TODO: Check if this graph degree distribution matches a powerlaw distribution
Devney showed that it did, but we can use snap to have another source of evidence
